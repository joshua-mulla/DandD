The object can be no more than\r300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied\rspace you can see on the ground.\r• You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to\rregain all hit points, and you end all effects on them\rdescribed in the greater restoration spell.\r• You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance\rto a damage type you choose.\r• You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to\ra single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For\rinstance, you could make yourself and all your companions\rimmune to a lich’s life drain attack.\r• You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of\rany roll made within the last round (including your\rlast turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the\rnew result. For example, a wish spell could undo an\ropponent’s successful save, a foe’s critical hit, or a\rfriend’s failed save.

For each\rof those days that you spend resting and doing nothing\rmore than light activity, your remaining recovery time\rdecreases by 2 days.
